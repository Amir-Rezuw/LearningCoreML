The app is developed based on the iOS course from Udemy: 
https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/

Some alters were made on layout (Instead of using camera only I utilized Bar button group and option to pick photo from photo library (PHPicker) or use camera to take a photo (UIImagePickerController) )

Hope you enjoy ðŸ˜‰.
